Create djangpg's keyring and import your server keypair:

	gpg --homedir keyring/ --import private_key.gpg public_key.gpg

Edit settings.py.  In addition to the usual Django settings, you'll need to change the following:

	GPG:
		HOMEDIR: the *absolute path* of the keyring directory
		SERVER_KEY: the ID of your server keypair
		SERVER_PASSPHRASE: the passphrase of your server key
		ENCMAIL_FROM: email address that encrypted mail will be sent from
	EMAIL_HOST: SMTP server through which to send mail
	EMAIL_PORT
	EMAIL_USE_TLS
	EMAIL_HOST_USER
	EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

Set up the database:

	python manage.py syncdb

Change the permissions on the keyring directory so that the webserver can write to it:

	chown -R root.www-data keyring/
	chmod -R g+rw keyring/
